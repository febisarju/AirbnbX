# AirbnbX: Price Prediction Using Regression
This project aims to analyze Airbnb listings and predict rental prices based on various factors like location, amenities, and demand. Using machine learning techniques, we derive insights and build an accurate regression model.
 
Features:
- Data Analysis: Explores the impact of various features on rental prices.
- Model Building: Implements regression models to predict prices.
- Visualization: Utilizes Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.

Technologies Used:
- Python: Data processing and model building.
- Pandas: Data manipulation.
- Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: Machine learning (Linear Regression, Decision Tree).
- Jupyter Notebook: Development environment.

Dataset:
- Airbnb NYC 2019
